# PoppyWatch

A common method to recognizing emotions associated with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)/Operational Stress Injury(OSI) is self monitoring. This method involves recognizing moments where your mood and emotions are much stronger or change more drastically. This usually involves tracking on paper and writing it all down.

In the workplace, it can feel like there is a stigma with writing emotions down or even facing those emotions. PoppyWatch is associated with Fitbit, allowing the person to press down a button for when they have an episode, and later can go onto the website and record down their emotions and situation and more, while the Fitbit tracks the heart rate, time and location. PoppyWatch makes self-monitoring easier and more comfortable in a stressful environment that Veterans and First Responders have to deal with.
